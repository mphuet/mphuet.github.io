Hi, I’m Moïra-Phoebé Huet, an auditory neuroscientist combining experimental and computational approaches to investigate how cognitive goals and states shape cortical representations of complex sounds.

My research integrates EEG neural tracking, psychophysics, and spectrotemporal modeling to examine how higher-level cognitive processes interact with acoustic structure to influence auditory perception.

I completed my PhD in psychoacoustics at [CRNL](https://www.crnl.fr/en/equipe/cap?language=en), University of Lyon and [LVA](https://lva.insa-lyon.fr/), INSA Lyon, where I developed advanced computational models of neural responses to study speech segregation in complex listening environments, bridging psychoacoustics and cognitive neuroscience.

At [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), within the Laboratory for Computational Audition and Perception [LCAP](https://engineering.jhu.edu/lcap/), I extend this work to explore how attentional orientation reshapes auditory filtering and neural encoding in noisy environments.
