Hi, I’m Moïra-Phoebé Huet, a postdoctoral researcher in the [LCAP Lab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/lcap/) within the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Johns Hopkins University.

I completed my Ph.D. in psychoacoustics at the [CRNL – University of Lyon](https://www.crnl.fr/en/equipe/cap?language=en) and [LVA – INSA Lyon](https://lva.insa-lyon.fr/). My [dissertation](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03178835/file/these.pdf), titled *"Voice Mixology at a Cocktail Party"*, examined how listeners segregate speech streams in noisy, multi-talker environments using behavioral experiments and EEG-based modeling (TRF). This work highlighted how speaker similarity, spatial cues, and semantic context influence intelligibility and neural encoding.

At Johns Hopkins, I extend these computational and neurological frameworks to investigate how cognitive goals and auditory attention shape brain responses to sound. I am particularly interested in bridging cognitive neuroscience and computational approaches to better understand how the brain parses complex acoustic scenes.
