Moïra-Phoebé Huet is an assitant Research Scientist in the [LCAP Lab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/lcap/) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Johns Hopkins University.

She completed her PhD in psychoacoustics at the [CRNL – University of Lyon](https://www.crnl.fr/en/equipe/cap?language=en) and [LVA – INSA Lyon](https://lva.insa-lyon.fr/). Her [thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03178835/file/these.pdf), titled *"Voice Mixology at a Cocktail Party"*, examined how listeners segregate speech streams in noisy, multi-talker environments using behavioral experiments and EEG-based modeling (TRF). This work highlighted how speaker similarity, spatial cues, and semantic context influence intelligibility and neural encoding.

At Johns Hopkins, she extends these computational and neurological frameworks to investigate how cognitive goals and auditory attention shape brain responses to sound. She is particularly interested in bridging cognitive neuroscience and computational approaches to better understand how the brain parses complex acoustic scenes.
