Hi!  
I am a postdoctoral researcher at **Johns Hopkins University**, working in the field of **cognitive neuroscience** with a focus on **auditory perception**, **EEG**, and **computational modeling**.

My research explores how the brain processes complex acoustic environments, such as speech in noise, and how neural encoding is shaped by cognitive goals. I use methods such as neural tracking (TRF), spectro-temporal modeling (MRF), and machine learning applied to EEG.
